# Guide: Component customization

There are many ways that Forge components can be customized. Whether you are looking for theming, overriding internal styles
within the Shadow DOM, or looking to extend a component with new functionality you will find information about how to go
about that within this guide.

Certain aspects of this level of customization may require you to use Forge as a library itself
to base your own component library from, and others will be supported natively within the library to allow for customization
within your application.

> Before reading this guide, it may be worthwhile to familiarize yourself with the [component architecture](?path=/story/guides-component-architecture--page).
